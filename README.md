# M152PotatoSite

## Module 152 explained
This repository exists because of the apprenticeship module (class) 152.
The module is about integrating different media contents into the frontend.
See the documentation folder for the long description or go to this [link](https://cf.ict-berufsbildung.ch/modules.php?name=Mbk&a=20101&cmodnr=152&noheader=1).

## Why this repository exists
This repository contains the final project, we have done for the class.

### Project theme
We decided as a team to do a potato site. That means that we showcase how awesome potatoes are and what menus you can create with it.

## Technologies
- HTML
- JavaScript
- CSS

## What the future holds
We did this project for the class and we will not update it anymore.
Feel free to check it out if you want to.
Please be aware that the project is from very early in our careers and that our code quality improved since this project.
